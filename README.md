This is not a virus for the first time, but it's a tool similar to "NotMyFault" and was based on that.



Here's why it isn't a virus:

It's a diagnostic tool.

A way to observe how Microsoft intentionally restricts dangerous kernel APIs.



Useful for:

Crash dump testing

System monitoring validation

Driver and kernel debugging

Learning how Windows defends itself










This is not guaranteed to cause a BSOD; it's made for fun and to be useful.




 My intent is to understand system boundaries and help me understand APIs and why they're restricted.
